## ALTERNATIVE: SIMPLE VERSION (If Limited Resources)

If you can't produce a full cinematic video, a **simpler but effective version**:

**Equipment Needed:**
- Smartphone with good camera (1080p)
- Free video editor (CapCut, InShot, iMovie)
- Quiet room

**Structure:**
1. **0:00-0:30:** You presenting to camera (introduction, problem statement)
2. **0:30-1:30:** Screen recording of dashboard (share screen via Zoom/Google Meet, record)
3. **1:30-2:00:** Back to camera (impact metrics, testimonial quote)
4. **2:00-2:30:** Call to action, show contact info

**Tips:**
- Look at camera (not screen)
- Good lighting (face camera toward window or use lamp)
- Speak clearly, enthusiastically
- Use cue cards (place behind camera)
- Smile! (passion is contagious)

**This is better than no video—authenticity matters!**

## FINAL TIPS FOR SUCCESS

1. **Keep It Simple:** Don't overcomplicate. Clear narration + good screen recording > fancy effects.

2. **Show, Don't Just Tell:** Demonstrate the dashboard actually working (live data updates, clicking features).

3. **Emphasize AI:** Judges want to see AI in action—spend time on ML predictions, not just sensor readings.

4. **Humanize It:** Farmer testimonials create emotional connection (critical for impact-focused challenges).

5. **Professional Audio:** Bad audio ruins good video. Invest time in clear narration.

6. **Test on Mobile:** Many judges may watch on phones—ensure text is readable.

7. **Call to Action:** End strong with vision and contact info (make it easy to follow up).

8. **Authenticity Over Perfection:** A genuine, passionate demo beats a soulless corporate video.
